I think the decision tree is going to work for politician dataset.
Because it is a discrete-valued functions that we need to learn. Since
the decision tree does not have hard bias, it basically can represent
any problem. So I think decision tree can be used to learn it.

Same reason for education dataset. Both the input and output is discrete
values. Therefore it is suitable for decision tree.
