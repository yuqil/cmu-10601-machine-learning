What kind of words did you find?
I found very meaningful word that can distinguish the two parties. These are very unique terms.

Are there any over- lapping words between the two lists?
No. There are no overlapping words between the lists.

How are these words different from what you found with top- words.py / topwords.java?
In top-words.py we find very common words that appear in both party's blogs.
Here we find words specific to each parties. That is to say liberty party would use these but democratic people hardly
uses these words.
