q   accuracy
0   The accuracy is not available due to zero.
0.1 0.8333
0.5 0.8056
1   0.8056
1.5 0.8056

I think with smoothing, we will not get zero if one of the word did not show in text_j.
When q is very low, the smoothing effect is low. So the accuracy is higher.
When q is higher, the smoothing effect is higher. We can see 0.5 -1.5 is worse than q = 0.1.
